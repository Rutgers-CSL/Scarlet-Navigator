## About
Scarlet Navigator is a free and open source project designed to make planning your courses less confusing and more intuitive. By looking at the bigger picture, you'll be more confident about your path towards graduation. This project is not managed nor sponsored by Rutgers University, so any feedback or bug reports should either be posted here or emailed to me.

Technology: React, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Firebase, Algolia

## Roadmap

Scarlet Navigator is not ready for contributions as it still needs a cleanup. But once everything has been re-written well, contributions are welcome! In the meantime, if you're good at web-scraping, let me know as Scarlet Navigator needs to scrape major requirement details, niche courses, etc.
